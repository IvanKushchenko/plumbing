to support the browser's form validation feedback, powered by the\n// `required` attribute, we have to \"hide\" the inputs via `clip`. We cannot use\n// `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` as that also hides the popover.\n// Simply visually hiding the inputs via `opacity` would leave them clickable in\n// certain cases which is prevented by using `clip` and `pointer-events`.\n// This way, we ensure a DOM element is visible to position the popover from.\n//\n// See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/12794 and\n// https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/14559 for more information.\n\n.btn-group-toggle {\n  > .btn,\n  > .btn-group > .btn {\n    margin-bottom: 0; // Override default `<label>` value\n\n    input[type=\"radio\"],\n    input[type=\"checkbox\"] {\n      position: absolute;\n      clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n      pointer-events: none;\n    }\n  }\n}\n","// stylelint-disable selector-no-qualifying-type\n\n//\n// Base styles\n//\n\n.input-group {\n  position: relative;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap; // For form validation feedback\n  align-items: stretch;\n  width: 100%;\n\n  > .form-control,\n  > .form-control-plaintext,\n  > .custom-select,\n  > .custom-file {\n    position: relative; // For focus state's z-index\n    flex: 1 1 auto;\n    // Add width 1% and flex-basis auto to ensure that button will not wrap out\n    // the column.
